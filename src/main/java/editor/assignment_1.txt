We chose two doubly linked-lists as our data structures in this assignment. One for the characters and another one for
the lines (CharNode and LineNode classes). So a document object can contain several lines who are linked to each other,
and each line contains several characters who are linked to each other.

The reason why we chose the doubly linked-list is because of the tasks of a text editor. You usually insert or delete
one character at the time, and with a doubly linked-list it will take in the worst case O(1) time no mather where the
cursor is. The same goes for making a new line, deleting it, moving the cursor.
This is because in a linked-list you only need to manipulate the previous, next and current node. While in
for example an ArrayList, when you insert or delete an element the indexes of the following n elements have to be
changed.

This is a simple application, there is no implementation yet of a functionality for searching in the document.
That would take 0(n) time. This application prints each character of each line which takes 0(n^2), something we do
believe could be changed by implementing a better way for presenting the text.
